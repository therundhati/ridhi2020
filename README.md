<If you're here because you need help, the password is the answer to this riddle:  
I'll often sing a pretty song  
It's deep and sweet and not too long  
Huntsmen come and huntsmen go  
But they'll never capture me you know  
I'll never trust you, I'm out of reach  
You'll only catch me if you're unique  
If you try to touch me, I'll fly away  
But if you make me comfortable, I will stay  
One moment I am flying high  
The next I'll crash and burn and die  
But out of the ashes, you'll see me rise  
To look at life with brand new eyes.>
